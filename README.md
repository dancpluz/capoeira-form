## 📚 About

The main goal of this project was to apply concepts of HTML for forms and CSS styling to create a functional and visually appealing web page. The page consists of a survey/registration form that collects user information, such as name, email, age, and previous experience with Capoeira.

It was a great opportunity to practice using different types of `input` elements, such as `text`, `radio`, `checkbox`, and `dropdowns` (`select`), as well as `labels` and `fieldsets` to organize the content semantically.

## 📌 Features

-   **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
-   **Form Validation**: Uses HTML5 attributes like `required`, `min`, and `max` for basic field validation.
-   **Custom Styling**: CSS was used to create a clean layout with a gradient background, custom Google Fonts, and a cohesive color palette.
-   **Semantic Structure**: The HTML is structured to ensure accessibility and clarity.
